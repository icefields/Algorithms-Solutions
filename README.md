Given a string S, the task is to write a program to print all permutations of a given string. 

A permutation also called an “arrangement number” or “order,” is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. A string of length N has N! permutations. 

Examples:
```
Input: S = “ABC”
Output: “ABC”, “ACB”, “BAC”, “BCA”, “CBA”, “CAB”

Input: S = “XY”
Output: “XY”, “YX”
```
